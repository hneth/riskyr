# Welcome!
                                
On this page could be some information on what this app is about...

## Notes

The easiest way to quickly incorporate text into this shiny app would be to change the contents of `justamarkdownfile.md` (actually, this file contains what's displayed here).   
+ Nice CSS designs are available at [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/3/).    
+ Bootstrap also provides [these icons](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/bootstrap_icons_glyphicons.asp), so let's use them.   
+ For even more visualisation or branding, we can use or create icons from [here](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/vectors-market).    
+ Static content goes in the www directory.    



## To do list

For UI:

+ define colors    
+ use logo of uni.kn?    
+ add some dropdown menu tied to `switch` to have parameters from real studies (probably best placed in csv file in the static folder)
