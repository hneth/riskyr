Title: A toolbox for transparent communication and teaching of risk literacy
Description: Develops a set of basic risk literacy tools in R.
    We begin with a condition (e.g., a clinical disease) and corresponding decision (e.g., a diagnosis or test result). 
    Based on 4 basic input parameters (N, prevalence, sensitivity, specificity) the package provides a range of metrics and alternative representations.
    By offering a variety of perspectives on the interplay between these parameters, the package renders risk literacy training more transparent.
