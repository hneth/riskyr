\title{The specificity of a decision process or diagnostic procedure.}
\format{An object of class \code{numeric} of length 1.}
\usage{
spec
}
\description{
\code{spec} defines a decision's specificity value:
The conditional probability of the decision being negative
if the condition is FALSE.
}
\details{
Understanding or obtaining the specificity value \code{spec}:

\itemize{

\item \code{spec} is the conditional probability
  for a (correct) negative decision given that
  the condition is \code{FALSE}:

\code{spec = p(decision = negative | condition = FALSE)}

\code{spec} is the opposite conditional probability
  -- but not the complement --
  of the negative predictive value \code{\link{npv}}:

\code{npv = p(condition = FALSE | decision = negative)}

\item \code{spec} is the complement of the
  false alarm rate \code{\link{fart}}:

\code{spec = 1 - fart}

\item In natural frequencies,
  \code{spec} is the ratio of individuals for which
  \code{decision = negative} divided by the number of
  individuals for which \code{condition = FALSE}:

\code{spec = n(decision = negative) / n(condition = FALSE)}

\item \code{spec} is a feature of a decision process
  or diagnostic procedure and a measure of
  correct decisions (true negatives).

However, due to being a conditional probability,
  the value of \code{spec} also depends on the
  condition's prevalence value \code{\link{prev}}.

}
}
\examples{
spec <- .75     # => sets a specificity value of 75\%
spec <- 75/100  # => (decision = negative) for 75 people out of 100 people for which (condition = FALSE)
is_prob(spec)   # => TRUE (as spec is a probability)
