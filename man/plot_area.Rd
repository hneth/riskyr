\arguments{
\item{prev}{The condition's prevalence \code{\link{prev}}
(i.e., the probability of condition being \code{TRUE}).}

\item{sens}{The decision's sensitivity \code{\link{sens}}
(i.e., the conditional probability of a positive decision
provided that the condition is \code{TRUE}).
\code{sens} is optional when its complement \code{mirt} is provided.}

\item{mirt}{The decision's miss rate \code{\link{mirt}}
(i.e., the conditional probability of a negative decision
provided that the condition is \code{TRUE}).
\code{mirt} is optional when its complement \code{sens} is provided.}

\item{spec}{The decision's specificity value \code{\link{spec}}
(i.e., the conditional probability
of a negative decision provided that the condition is \code{FALSE}).
\code{spec} is optional when its complement \code{fart} is provided.}

\item{fart}{The decision's false alarm rate \code{\link{fart}}
(i.e., the conditional probability
of a positive decision provided that the condition is \code{FALSE}).
\code{fart} is optional when its complement \code{spec} is provided.}

\item{N}{The number of individuals in the population.
A suitable value of \code{\link{N}} is computed, if not provided.
Note: \code{\link{N}} is not represented in the plot,
but used for computing frequency information \code{\link{freq}}
from current probabilities \code{\link{prob}}.}

\item{by}{A character code specifying 2 perspectives that split the population into subsets,
with 6 options:
  \enumerate{
  \item \code{"cddc"}: by condition (cd) and by decision (dc) (default);
  \item \code{"cdac"}: by condition (cd) and by accuracy (ac);

  }}

with 2 options:
  \enumerate{
  \item \code{"v"}: vertical (default);
  \item \code{"h"}: horizontal.
  }}

\item{area}{A character code specifying the shape of the main area,
with 2 options:
  \enumerate{
  \item \code{"sq"}: main area is scaled to square (default);
  \item \code{"no"}: no scaling (rectangular area fills plot size).
  }}

\item{scale}{Scale probabilities and corresponding area dimensions either by
exact probability or by (rounded or non-rounded) frequency, with 2 options:
  \enumerate{
  \item \code{"p"}: scale main area dimensions by exact probability (default);
  \item \code{"f"}: re-compute probabilities from (rounded or non-rounded) frequencies
  and scale main area dimensions by their frequency.
  }
 Note: \code{scale} setting matters for the display of probability values and for
 area plots with small population sizes \code{\link{N}} when \code{round = TRUE}.}

\item{round}{A Boolean option specifying whether computed frequencies
are rounded to integers. Default: \code{round = TRUE}.}

\item{sum_w}{Border width of 2 perspective summaries
(on top and left borders) of main area as a proportion of area size
(i.e., in range \code{0 <= sum_w <= 1}).
Default: \code{sum_w = .10}.
Setting \code{sum_w = 0}, \code{NA}, or \code{NULL} removes summaries;
setting \code{sum_w = 1} scales summaries to same size as main areas.}

(used for \code{f_lbl = "def" OR "namnum"}).
Use \code{f_lbl_sep = ":\n"} to add a line break between name and numeric value.
Default: \code{f_lbl_sep = NA} (set to \code{" = "} or \code{":\n"} based on \code{f_lbl}).}

\description{
\code{plot_area} assigns the total probability
or population frequency to an area (square or rectangle)
and shows the probability or frequency of
4 classification cases (\code{\link{hi}}, \code{\link{mi}},
\code{\link{fa}}, \code{\link{cr}})
as relative proportions of this area.
}
\details{
\code{plot_area} computes probabilities \code{\link{prob}}
and frequencies \code{\link{freq}}
from a sufficient and valid set of 3 essential probabilities
(\code{\link{prev}}, and
\code{\link{sens}} or its complement \code{\link{mirt}}, and
\code{\link{spec}} or its complement \code{\link{fart}})
or existing frequency information \code{\link{freq}}
and a population size of \code{\link{N}} individuals.

\code{plot_area} generalizes and replaces \code{\link{plot_mosaic}}.
by removing the dependency on the R packages \code{vcd} and \code{grid}
and providing many additional options.
