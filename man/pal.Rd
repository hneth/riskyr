\usage{
pal
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Color representing the \emph{population} (of N cases or individuals).}

\item{true}{Color representing cases for which the current condition is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{false}{Color representing cases for which the current condition is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{hi}{Color representing \emph{hits} or true positives
(i.e., correct cases for which the current condition is TRUE and the decision is positive).}

\item{mi}{Color representing \emph{misses} or false negatives
(i.e., incorrect cases for which the current condition is TRUE but the decision is negative).}

\item{fa}{Color representing \emph{false alarms} or false positives
(i.e., incorrect cases for which the current condition is FALSE but the decision is positive).}

\item{cr}{Color representing \emph{correct rejections} or true negatives
(i.e., correct cases for which the current condition is FALSE and the decision is negative).}

\item{ppv}{Color representing \emph{positive predictive values} (i.e., the conditional probability that
the condition is TRUE, provided that the decision is positive).}

\item{npv}{Color representing \emph{negative predictive values} (i.e., the conditional probability that
the condition is FALSE, provided that the decision is negative).}

\description{
\code{pal} is initialized to a vector of named elements (colors)
to define the color scheme for the current scenario that is
used throughout the \code{riskyr} package.
}
\details{
All color information corresponding to the current scenario
is stored as named colors in a vector \code{pal}.
To change a color, assign a new color to an existing element name.
}
\examples{
pal       # displays the vector of all current color names and values
pal["hi"] # displays the current color for hits (true positives)
pal["hi"] <- "green3" # defines a new color for hits (true positives)
