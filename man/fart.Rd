\title{The false alarm rate of a decision process or diagnostic procedure.}
\format{An object of class \code{logical} of length 1.}
\usage{
fart
}
\description{
\code{fart} defines a decision's false alarm rate
or the rate of false positive decisions: The conditional probability
of the decision being positive if the condition is FALSE.
}
\details{
Understanding or obtaining the false alarm rate \code{fart}:

\itemize{

\item Definition:
  \code{fart} is the conditional probability
  for an (incorrect) positive decision given that
  the condition is \code{FALSE}:

\code{fart = p(decision = positive | condition = FALSE)}

or the probability of a false alarm.

\item Alternative names:
  \code{fallout}, false positive rate (\code{FPR}),
  rate of Type I errors

\item Relationships:

\code{fart} is the complement of the
  specificity \code{\link{spec}}:

\code{fart = 1 - spec}

\item In natural frequencies,
  \code{fart} is the ratio of individuals for which
  \code{decision = positive} divided by the number of
  individuals for which \code{condition = FALSE}:

\code{fart = n(decision = positive) / n(condition = FALSE)}

\item \code{fart} is a feature of a decision process
  or diagnostic procedure and a measure of
  incorrect decisions (false positives).

However, due to being a conditional probability,
  the value of \code{fart} also depends on the
  condition's prevalence value \code{\link{prev}}.

\examples{
fart <- .25     # => sets a false alarm rate of 25\%
fart <- 25/100  # => (decision = positive) for 25 people out of 100 people for which (condition = FALSE)
is_prob(fart)   # => TRUE (as fart is a probability)
