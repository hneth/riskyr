\description{
\code{prob} is a list of named numeric variables
containing 3 essential (1 non-conditional \code{\link{prev}} and
2 conditional \code{\link{sens}} and \code{\link{spec}}) probabilities
and 8 derived (\code{\link{ppod}} and \code{\link{acc}},
as well as 6 conditional) probabilities:
}
\details{
\code{prob} currently contains the following probabilities:

\enumerate{

\item the condition's prevalence \code{\link{prev}}
 (i.e., the probability of the condition being \code{TRUE}):
 \code{prev = \link{cond.true}/\link{N}}.

\item the decision's sensitivity \code{\link{sens}}
 (i.e., the conditional probability of a positive decision
 provided that the condition is \code{TRUE}).

\item the decision's miss rate \code{\link{mirt}}
 (i.e., the conditional probability of a negative decision
 provided that the condition is \code{TRUE}).

\item the decision's specificity \code{\link{spec}}
 (i.e., the conditional probability
 of a negative decision provided that the condition is \code{FALSE}).

\item the decision's false alarm rate \code{\link{fart}}
 (i.e., the conditional probability
 of a positive decision provided that the condition is \code{FALSE}).

\item the proportion (baseline probability or rate)
 of the decision being positive \code{\link{ppod}}
 (but not necessarily true):
 \code{ppod = \link{dec.pos}/\link{N}}.

\item the decision's positive predictive value \code{\link{PPV}}
 (i.e., the conditional probability of the condition being \code{TRUE}
 provided that the decision is positive).

\item the decision's false detection (or false discovery) rate \code{\link{FDR}}
 (i.e., the conditional probability of the condition being \code{FALSE}
 provided that the decision is positive).

\item the decision's negative predictive value \code{\link{NPV}}
 (i.e., the conditional probability of the condition being \code{FALSE}
 provided that the decision is negative).

\item the decision's false omission rate \code{\link{FOR}}
 (i.e., the conditional probability of the condition being \code{TRUE}
 provided that the decision is negative).

\item the accuracy \code{\link{acc}}
 (i.e., probability of correct decisions \code{\link{dec.cor}} or
 correspondence of decisions to conditions).

\item the conditional probability \code{p_acc_hi}
 (i.e., the probability of \code{\link{hi}} given that
 the decision is correct \code{\link{dec.cor}}).

\item the conditional probability \code{p_err_fa}
 (i.e., the probability of \code{\link{fa}} given that
 the decision is erroneous \code{\link{dec.err}}).

}

These probabilities are computed from basic probabilities
(contained in \code{\link{num}}) and computed by using
\code{\link{comp_prob}}.

The list \code{prob} is the probability counterpart
to the list containing frequency information \code{\link{freq}}.

Note that inputs of extreme probabilities (of 0 or 1)
may yield unexpected values (e.g., an \code{\link{NPV}}
value of NaN when \code{\link{is_extreme_prob_set}}
evaluates to \code{TRUE}).

prob <- comp_prob()  # => initialize prob to default parameters
