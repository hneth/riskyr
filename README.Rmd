# `riskyr`

**A toolbox for rendering risk literacy more transparent.**

Starting with a condition (e.g., a disease), a corresponding decision (e.g., a clinical judgment or diagnostic test), and basic probabilities (e.g., the condition's prevalence `prev`, and the decision's sensitivity `sens` and specificity `spec`) we provide a range of functions and metrics to compute, translate, and represent risk-related information (e.g., as probabilities or frequencies for a population of `N` individuals). By offering a variety of perspectives on the interplay between key parameters, `riskyr` renders teaching and training of risk literacy more transparent. 


## Motivation 

> Solving a problem simply means representing it <br>
> so as to make the solution transparent. (H.A. Simon)[^1]

[^1]: Simon, H.A. (1996). _The Sciences of the Artificial_ (3rd ed.). The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA. (p. 132).


The issues addressed by `riskyr` are less of a _computational_ and more of a _representational_ nature (i.e., concerning the expression in and translation between different formats of information). Whereas people tend to find it difficult to understand and compute information expressed in terms of _probabilities_, the same information is often easy to understand and compute when expressed in terms of _frequencies_. But rather than just expressing probabilistic information in terms of frequencies, `riskyr` allows translating between formats and illustrates their relationships in a variety of transparent and interactive ways.

Basic assumptions and goals driving the current development of `riskyr` include the following:

1. Effective training in risk literacy requires simple tools and transparent representations. 

2. More specifically, it would be desirable to have a set of (computational and representational) tools that allow various 
calculations, translations (between formats), and a range of alternative views on the interplay between probabilities and frequencies. 

3. Seeing a variety of visualizations that illustrate how parameters and metrics interact and influence each other facilitates active and explorative learning.  It is particularly helpful to view the same or similar relationships from alternative representations or to inspect the change of one parameter as a function of changes in other parameters. 


To deliver on these assumptions and goals, `riskyr` provides a range of computational and representational tools. Importantly, the objects and functions in the `riskyr` toolbox are not isolated, but complement, support, and explain each other. All functions and visualizations can be explored interactively, providing immediate feedback on the effect of changes in parameter values.  
By providing a variety of customization options, users can explore and design representations of risk-related information that suit their personal goals and needs. 


## Installation

You can install the latest development version of `riskyr` from its [GitHub](https://github.com) repository at <https://github.com/hneth/riskyr>: 

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hneth/riskyr")
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(riskyr)  # load riskyr

## Define your own scenario: ----------

## View parameters:

## View graphics: 


## Inspect an existing riskyr scenario: ---------- 

s <- scenarios$n21  # assign pre-defined Scenario_21 to s

## View parameters:
summary(s)  # print scenario summary information
summary(s, summarize = "prob")  # summarize prob
summary(s, summarize = "freq")  # summarize freq

## View graphics: 
plot(s)    # plots a network diagram (by default)
plot(s, plottype = "icons")
plot(s, plottype = "mosaic")
plot(s, plottype = "curve", what = "all")
plot(s, plottype = "plane", what = "PPV")
```
