Risk literacy tools in R

We start with a set of global variables:

- population size
- prevalence of some condition 
- sensitivity or probability of treatment success
- specificity or probability of side effects 

and provide a variety of perspectives on the interplay of these variables:

1. tree of natural frequencies
2. icon array (with population vs. sample view)
3. contingency table (leaves of the frequency tree)
4. curves of PPV and NPV (as a function of prevalence or sensitivity/specificity)
5. fact boxes (with additional details on benefits and harms)

All visualizations will be interactive and use a common color scheme.

A set of examples illustrates cases with known data from the literature.
