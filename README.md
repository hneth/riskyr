========

**A toolbox for rendering risk literacy more transparent**

Starting with a condition (e.g., a disease), a corresponding decision (e.g., a clinical judgment or diagnostic test), and basic probabilities (e.g., the condition's prevalence `prev`, and the decision's sensitivity `sens` and specificity `spec`) we provide a range of functions and metrics to compute, translate, and represent risk-related information (e.g., as probabilities or frequencies for a population of `N` individuals). By offering a variety of perspectives on the interplay between key parameters, `riskyr` renders teaching and training of risk literacy more transparent.

Motivation
----------

> Solving a problem simply means representing it <br> so as to make the solution transparent. (H.A. Simon)[1]

The issues addressed by `riskyr` are less of a *computational* and more of a *representational* nature (i.e., concerning the expression in and translation between different formats of information). Whereas people tend to find it difficult to understand and compute information expressed in terms of *probabilities*, the same information is often easy to understand and compute when expressed in terms of *frequencies*. But rather than just expressing probabilistic information in terms of frequencies, `riskyr` allows translating between formats and illustrates their relationships in a variety of transparent and interactive ways.

Basic assumptions and goals driving the current development of `riskyr` include the following:

<!-- riskyr logo: -->
<a href = "https://github.com/hneth/riskyr"> <!-- <img src = "./inst/pix/riskyr_cube.png" alt = "riskyr" style = "width: 180px; float: right; border:20;"/> --> <img src = "./inst/pix/riskyr_cube_s.png" alt = "riskyr" style = "float: right; border:20;"/> </a> <!-- ![riskyr](./inst/pix/riskyr_cube.png) --> <!-- knitr::include_graphics("./inst/pix/riskyr_cube.png") -->

1.  Effective training in risk literacy requires simple tools and transparent representations.

2.  More specifically, it would be desirable to have a set of (computational and representational) tools that allow various calculations, translations (between formats), and a range of alternative views on the interplay between probabilities and frequencies.

3.  Seeing a variety of visualizations that illustrate how parameters and metrics interact and influence each other facilitates active and explorative learning. It is particularly helpful to view the same or similar relationships from alternative representations or to inspect the change of one parameter as a function of changes in other parameters.

To deliver on these assumptions and goals, we provide a range of computational and representational tools. Importantly, the objects and functions in the `riskyr` toolbox are not isolated, but complement, explain, and support each other. All functions and visualizations can be used separately and explored interactively, providing immediate feedback on the effect of changes in parameter values. By providing a variety of customization options, users can explore and design representations of risk-related information that suit their personal goals and needs.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

### Defining a scenario

`riskyr` is designed to address problems like the following:[2]

> **Screening for hustosis**
>
> A new screening device for detecting the clinical condition of *hustosis* is developed. Its current version is very good, but not yet perfect. It has the following properties:
> 1. About 4% of the general population suffer from *hustosis*.
> 2. If someone suffers from hustosis, there is a chance of 80% that he or she will test positively for the condition.
> 3. If someone is free from hustosis, there is a chance of 4% that he or she will still test positively for the condition.
>
> Mr. and Ms. Smith have both been screened with this device:
> - Mr. Smith tested positively (i.e., received a diagnosis of hustosis).
> - Ms. Smith tested negatively (i.e., was judged to be free of hustosis).
>
> Please answer the following questions:
> - What is the probability that Mr. Smith actually suffers from hustosis?
> - What is the probability that Ms. Smith is actually free of hustosis?

#### Probabilities provided

The first challenge in solving such problems is in understanding the information provided. The problem description provides three essential probabilities:

1.  The condition's *prevalence* (in the general population) of 4%: `prev = .04`.
2.  The device's or diagnostic decision's *sensitivity* of 80%: `sens = .80`.
3.  The device's or diagnostic decision's *false alarm rate* of 4%, implying a *specificity* of (100% âˆ’ 4%) = 96%: `spec = .04`.

#### Understanding the questions asked

The second challenge here lies in understanding the questions that are being asked -- and in realizing that their answers are *not* simply the decision's sensitivity or specificity values. Instead, we are asked to provide two *conditional* probabilities:

-   The conditional probability of suffering from the condition given a positive test result, <br>aka. the *positive predictive value* (`PPV`).
-   The conditional probability of being free of the condition given a negative test result, <br>aka. the *negative predictive value* (`NPV`).

#### Translating into frequencies

One of the best tricks in risk literacy education is to translate probabilistic information into frequencies.[3] To do this, we imagine a representative sample of `N = 1000` individuals. Rather than asking about the probabilities for Mr. and Ms. Smith, we could re-frame the questions as:

> Assuming a representative sample of 1000 individuals:
> - What proportion of individuals with a positive test result actually suffer from hustosis?
> - What proportion of individuals with a negative test result are actually free of hustosis?

#### Using `riskyr`

Here is how `riskyr` allows you to view and solve such problems:

``` r
library(riskyr)  # loads the package
#> Welcome to riskyr!
#> riskyr.guide() opens user guides.
```

#### Creating a scenario

Let us define a new `riskyr` scenario (called `hustosis`) with the information provided by our problem:

``` r
## (1) Create your own scenario: ----------
hustosis <- riskyr(scen.lbl = "Example", 
                   cond.lbl = "hustosis",
                   dec.lbl = "screening test",
                   popu.lbl = "representative sample", 
                   N = 1000, 
                   prev = .04, sens = .80, spec = (1 - .05)
                   )
```

#### Summary

To obtain a quick overview of key parameter values, we could ask for the `summary` of our `hustosis` scenario:

``` r
summary(hustosis)  # summarizes key parameter values
#> Scenario:  Example 
#> 
#> Condition:  hustosis 
#> Decision:  screening test 
#> Population:  representative sample 
#> N =  1000 
#> Source:  Source information for this scenario 
#> 
#> Probabilities:
#> 
#>  Essential probabilities:
#> prev sens mirt spec fart 
#> 0.04 0.80 0.20 0.95 0.05 
#> 
#>  Other probabilities:
#>  ppod   PPV   NPV   FDR   FOR 
#> 0.080 0.400 0.991 0.600 0.009 
#> 
#> Frequencies:
#> 
#>  by conditions:
#>  cond.true cond.false 
#>         40        960 
#> 
#>  by decision:
#> dec.pos dec.neg 
#>      80     920 
#> 
#>  by correspondence (of decision to condition):
#> dec.cor dec.err 
#>     944      56 
#> 
#>  4 essential (SDT) frequencies:
#>  hi  mi  fa  cr 
#>  32   8  48 912 
#> 
#> Accuracy:
#> 
#>  acc:
#> 0.944
```

The summary distinguishes between probabilities, frequencies, and accuracy information. In `Probabilities` we find the answer to both of our questions when taking into account the information provided above:

-   The conditional probability that Mr. Smith actually suffers from hustosis given his positive test result is 40% (as `PPV = 0.400`).

-   The conditional probability that Ms. Smith is actually free of hustosis given her negative test result is 99.1% (as `NPV = 0.991`).

In case you are surprised by these answers, you are a good candidate for additional instruction in risk literacy. One of the strengths of `riskyr` is to analyze and view the scenario from a variety of different perspectives. Here is a quick overview over its different types of visualizations:

#### Tree diagram

``` r
## View graphics: 
plot(hustosis, plot.type = "tree", by = "dc")  # plot a tree diagram (by decision):
```

This particular tree, which splits the population of `N = 1000` individuals into two subgroups *by decision* (`by = "dc"`), actually contains the answer to the second version of our questions:

-   The proportion of individuals with a positive test result who actually suffer from hustosis is the frequency of "true positive" cases (shown in darker green) divided by "decision positive" cases (shown in purple): `32/80 = .400` (corresponding to our value of `PPV` above).
-   The proportion of individuals with a negative test result who are actually free from hustosis is the frequency of "true negative" cases (shown in lighter green) divided by "decision negative" cases (shown in blue): `912/920 = .991` (corresponding to our value of `NPV` above, except for minimal differences due to rounding).

Of course, the frequencies of these ratios were already contained in the `hustosis` summary above. But the representation in the form of a tree diagram makes it easier to understand which frequencies are required to answer the question.

#### Icon array

``` r
plot(hustosis, plot.type = "icons")   # plot an icon array: 
```

#### Mosaic plot

``` r
plot(hustosis, plot.type = "mosaic")  # plot a mosaic plot: 
```

#### Curves

``` r
plot(hustosis, plot.type = "curve")   # plot curves (as a function of prevalence):
```

#### Planes

``` r
plot(hustosis, plot.type = "plane")   # plot plane (as a function of sens x spec):
```

### Using existing scenarios

As defining your own scenarios can be cumbersome and the literature is full of existing problems (that study so-called Bayesian reasoning), `riskyr` provides a set of -- currently 25) -- pre-defined scenarios (stored in a list `scenarios`). Here is an example that shows how you can select and explore them:

#### Selecting a scenario

Let us assume you want to learn more about the controversy surrounding screening prodecures of prostate-cancer (known as PSA screening). Scenario 21 in our collection of `scenarios` is from an article on this topic (Arkes & Gaissmaier, 2012). To select a particular scenario, simply assign it to an R object. For instance, we can assign Scenario 21 to `s21`:

``` r
## (2) Explore an existing riskyr scenario: ---------- 
s21 <- scenarios$n21  # assign pre-defined Scenario 21 to s21.
```

#### Summary

The following commands provide a quick overview of the scenario content in text form:

``` r
# Show basic scenario information: 
s21$scen.lbl  # shows descriptive label:
#> [1] "PSA test 1 (high prev)"
s21$cond.lbl  # shows current condition:
#> [1] "prostate cancer"
s21$dec.lbl   # shows current decision:
#> [1] "PSA test"
s21$popu.lbl  # shows current population:
#> [1] "1000 patients with symptoms diagnostic of prostate cancer taking a PSA test."
s21$scen.apa  # shows current source: 
#> [1] "Arkes, H. R., & Gaissmaier, W. (2012). Psychological research and the prostate-cancer screening controversy. Psychological Science, 23(6), 547--553."

#> 0.135 0.778 0.543 0.222 0.457 
#> 
#> Frequencies:
#> 
#>  by conditions:
#>  cond.true cond.false 
#>        500        500 
#> 
#>  by decision:
#> dec.pos dec.neg 
#>     135     865 
#> 
#>  by correspondence (of decision to condition):
#> dec.cor dec.err 
#>     575     425 
#> 
#>  4 essential (SDT) frequencies:
#>  hi  mi  fa  cr 
#> 105 395  30 470 
#> 
#> Accuracy:
#> 
#>  acc:
#> 0.575
```

Generating the following plots will provide you with a quick visual exploration of the scenario:

<!-- (We will only show the network plot here, and trust that you can try out the other ones for yourself.) -->
#### Network diagram

``` r
plot(s21) # plots a network diagram (by default):
```

#### Icon array

``` r
plot(s21, plot.type = "icons")   # plot an icon array: 
```

#### Mosaic plot

``` r
plot(s21, plot.type = "mosaic")   # plot a mosaic plot: 
```

#### Curves

The following curves show values of conditional probabilities as a function of prevalence:

``` r
plot(s21, plot.type = "curve", what = "all")  # plot all curves (as a function of prevalence):
```

#### Planes

The following surface shows the negative predictive value (NPV) as a function of sensitivity and specificity (for a given prevalence):

``` r
plot(s21, plot.type = "plane", what = "NPV")  # plot plane (as a function of sens x spec):
```

We hope that these examples succeeded in whetting your appetite for visual exploration. If so, call `riskyr.guide()` for viewing the package vignettes and obtaining additional information.
