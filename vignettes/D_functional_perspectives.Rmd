<!-- Introduction: --> 

The `riskyr` data structures essentially describe networks of dependencies. 
This is best illustrated by the network diagram (see examples of `plot_fnet` in the 
[user guide](A_user_guide.html) and [data formats](B_data_formats.html)). 
However, sometimes it is instructive to view all possible values of some parameter 
as a function of others. A functional perspective illustrates how the value of 
some parameter (or its values) changes as a function of other parameters 
(and their values). 

## Functions

The basic format of a function is $y = f(x)$, which illustrates how values of $y$ 
depend on values of $x$ given some function $f$. `riskyr` provides 2 functions for 
viewing parameters as a function of other parameters (and their values).

\end{aligned}

## Curves as a function of prevalence

The function `plot_curve` draws the curves (or lines) of selected parameters 
as a function of the prevalene (with `prev` ranging from 0 to 1) 
for a given decision process or diagnostic test (i.e., given values of `sens` and `spec`): 

$$y \ = \ f(\texttt{prev} \textrm{, from 0 to 1})  \textrm{ with } y \in \{\texttt{PPV}, \texttt{NPV}, \texttt{ppod}, \texttt{acc}\}  \ \ \ \ \ \   (1)$$

As an example, reconsider our original scenario (on mammography screening, see [user guide](A_user_guide.html)). Earlier, we computed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 7.8%. But rather than just computing a single value, we could ask: How do values of PPV develop as a function of prevalence? The `plot_curve` function illustrates this relationship: 

```{r plot_curve_1, fig.width = 7.2, fig.height = 5, fig.show = 'asis', fig.cap = "Curves that show PPV and NPV as a function of an prevalence (for given values of sensitivity and specificity) in the original mammography screening scenario."}
plot_curve(prev = .01, sens = .80, spec = (1 - .096), 
           what = c("prev", "PPV", "NPV"), 
           title.lbl = "Mammography screening", cex.lbl = .8)
```

The curves illustrate that values of `PPV` and `NPV` crucially depend on the value of prevalence `prev` in the current population. In fact, they actually vary across their entire range (i.e., from 0 to 1), rendering any communication of their value utterly meaningless without specifying the current population's prevalence value `prev`. 

The dependency of `PPV` and `NPV` on `prev` can be illustrated by assuming a higher prevalence rate. For instance, if we knew that some woman was genetically tested and known to exhibit the notorious BRCA1 mutation, the prevalence value of her corresponding population (given a positive mammography result in a routine screening) is increased to about 60%: 

```{r plot_curve_2, fig.width = 7.2, fig.height = 5, fig.show = 'asis', fig.cap = "Curves that show PPV and NPV as a function of an prevalence (for given values of sensitivity and specificity) when assuming an increased prevalence of 60%."}
high.prev <- .60   # assume increased prevalence due to BRCA1 mutation

plot_curve(prev = high.prev, sens = .80, spec = (1 - .096), 
           what = c("prev", "PPV", "NPV"), 
           title.lbl = "Mammography screening (BRCA1 mutation)", cex.lbl = .8)
```

This shows that --- given an increased prevalence value `prev` of 60% --- the positive predictive value `PPV` of a positive test result increases from 7.8% (in the standard population) to around 93% (given the BRCA1 mutation). 

Other curves (or rather lines) drawn by `plot_curve` include the proportion of positive decisions `ppod` and overall accuracy `acc`, 
each as a function of prevalence `prev`:

```{r plot_curve_3, fig.width = 7.2, fig.height = 5, fig.show = 'asis', fig.cap = "Curves that show PPV and NPV as a function of an prevalence (for given values of sensitivity and specificity) when assuming an increased prevalence of 60%."}
high.prev <- .60   # assume increased prevalence due to BRCA1 mutation

plot_curve(prev = high.prev, sens = .80, spec = (1 - .096), 
           what = c("prev", "PPV", "NPV", "ppod", "acc"), 
           title.lbl = "Mammography screening (BRCA1 mutation)", cex.lbl = .8)
```


## Planes as a function of sensitivity and specificity (for given prevalence)

The function `plot_plane` draws a plane for a selected parameter as a function of sensitivity and specificity 
(with `sens` and `spec` both ranging from 0 to 1) for a given prevalence `prev`: 

$$y \ = \ f(\texttt{sens} \times\ \texttt{spec} \textrm{, both from 0 to 1, for given value of } \texttt{prev}) \textrm{ with } y \in \{\texttt{PPV}, \texttt{NPV}, \texttt{ppod}, \texttt{acc}\}  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2)$$

Some examples:

```{r plot_plane, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4.5, fig.show = 'asis', fig.cap = "Planes that show PPV, NPV, the proportion of positive predictions (ppod) and overall accuracy (acc) as a function of sensitivity and specificity (for given prevalence)."}
plot_plane(prev = high.prev, sens = .80, spec = (1 - .096), what = "PPV",  title.lbl = "A. Mammography (BRCA1)", cex.lbl = .8)
plot_plane(prev = high.prev, sens = .80, spec = (1 - .096), what = "NPV",  title.lbl = "B. Mammography (BRCA1)", cex.lbl = .8)
plot_plane(prev = high.prev, sens = .80, spec = (1 - .096), what = "ppod", title.lbl = "C. Mammography (BRCA1)", phi = 45, cex.lbl = .8)
plot_plane(prev = high.prev, sens = .80, spec = (1 - .096), what = "acc",  title.lbl = "D. Mammography (BRCA1)", cex.lbl = .8)
```
