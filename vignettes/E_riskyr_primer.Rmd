`riskyr` is a toolbox for rendering risk literacy more transparent. Its goal is to gain deeper insights into risk-related scenarios with a minimum of hassle and maximum of fun.

This page assumes that you just installed the package and are now eager to see what you can do with it. (See the [User guide](A_user_guide.html) for a more general introduction.)


## Getting Started 

How can you use `riskyr`?  Basically, there are two ways to get started:

1. Define your own `riskyr` scenario from risk-related information (typically provided in terms of probabilities).

2. Inspect one of `r length(scenarios) - 1` predefined `riskyr` scenarios to get a glimpse of what types of scenarios are possible. 

Either way, you will soon explore some specific scenario and uncover relationships between its parameters. Let's load the package (in case you haven't already done so):

```{r load_riskyr}
library("riskyr")  # loads the package
```

### Defining your own scenario  

Let's launch your `riskyr`-career by creating a ficticious risk scenario that we construct from scratch: 


#### Example scenario

<!-- Example: Testing for recidivism -->

> **Identifying reoffenders**
> 
> Imagine you are developing a test to predict if a jailed criminal offender will reoffend after his or her release. 
> Your research yields the following information: 
>
> 1. 45% of 753 jailed offenders in this county re-offend after they are released (`prev = .45`).  
> 2. Your test correctly detects those who will re-offend in 98% of the cases (`sens = .98`).  
> 3. Your test falsely identifies 54% of those who will not re-offend as potential re-offenders. 
> Conversely, this implies that your test correctly identifies 46% of those that will not reoffend (`spec = .46`).  
> 
> John D. is about to get released. However, your test predicts that he will reoffend.  
> 
> What is the probability that John D. will actually reoffend, given this test result? 

To answer this question, you could calculate corresponding probabilities or frequencies (as explained in the [user guide](A_user_guide.html)). Alternatively, you can use the `riskyr()` function to create a `riskyr` scenario that you can modify, inspect, and visualize in various ways.


#### Necessary scenario information

<!-- A: necessary info: probabilities and N: --> 

First, let's translate the numeric information provided in our example into parameter values:

1. The probability of reoffending provides the _prevalence_ in our population: `prev = .45`.  

2. The test's conditional probability of correctly detecting a reoffender provides its _sensitivity_: `sens = .98`.  

3. The test's conditional probability of correctly detecting someone who will not reoffend provides its _specificity_: `spec = .46`.  
(This corresponds to a _false alarm rate_ `fart = 1 - spec = .54`.)  

4. In addition, the _population size_ of your sample was mentioned to be `N = 753`.[^1]

[^1]: If no population size value `N` is specified, a suitable value is provided.


The following code defines a perfectly valid `riskyr` scenario:

```{r create_scenario_minimal}
# Create a minimal scenario:
my.scenario <- riskyr(prev = .45, 
                      sens = .98,
                      spec = .46)
```

<!-- Mention alternative ways of entering the same (e.g., by providing fart, rather than spec)? --> 


#### Optional scenario information

<!-- B: optional info: text labels --> 

To make various outputs more recognizable, many aspects of a `riskyr` scenario can be described by setting optional `arguments`: 

* `scen.lbl` specifies a label by which you can reckognize the scenario (e.g., "Identifying reoffenders").  
* `popu.lbl` specifies the population of interest (e.g., "inmates").  

* `cond.lbl` specifies the condition of interest (i.e., "reoffending").
* `cond.true.lbl` specifies a label for the condition being true ("offends again").
* `cond.false.lbl` specifies a label for the condition being false ("does not offend again").

* `dec.lbl` specifies the nature of the decision, prediction, or test ("test result").
* `dec.pos.lbl` specifies a positive decision regarding the condition ("predict to reoffend").
* `dec.neg.lbl` specifies a negative decision regarding the condition ("predict to not reoffend").

* `hi.lbl`, `mi.lbl`, `fa.lbl`, and `cr.lbl` specify the four possible combinations of conditions and decisions: 
    1. hit: The test predicts that the inmate reoffends and s/he does ("reoffender found");   
    2. miss: The test predicts that the inmate does not reoffend but s/he does ("reoffender missed");   
    3. false alarm: The test predicts that the inmate reoffends but s/he does not ("false accusation";   
    4. correct rejection: The test predicts that the inmate does not reoffend and s/he does not ("correct release").  

Whereas specifying three essential probabilities is necessary to define a valid `riskyr` scenario, providing `N` and the other arguments are entirely optional. Let's create a well-specified `riskyr` scenario:

```{r create_scenario_custom}
# Create a customized scenario: 
my.scenario <- riskyr(scen.lbl = "Identifying reoffenders", 
                      popu.lbl = "inmates", 
                      cond.lbl = "reoffending",
                      cond.true.lbl = "offends again", cond.false.lbl = "does not offend again",
                      dec.lbl = "test result",
                      dec.pos.lbl = "predict to\nreoffend", dec.neg.lbl = "predict to\nnot reoffend",
                      hi.lbl = "reoffender found", mi.lbl = "reoffender missed",
                      fa.lbl = "false accusation", cr.lbl = "correct release",
                      prev = .45,  # prevalence of being a reoffender. 
                      sens = .98,  # p( will reoffend | offends again )
                      spec = .46,  # p( will not reoffend | does not offend again )
                      fart =  NA,  # p( will reoffend | does not offend gain )
                      N = 753,     # population size
                      scen.src = "(a ficticious example)")
```


#### Viewing scenario information

We _could_ inspect the details of `my.scenario` with `summary(my.scenario)`. But it's much more colorful to immediately check some visualizations of our scenario:

```{r fnet, include = FALSE, fig.width = 7.2, fig.height = 6}
plot(my.scenario, plot.type = "fnet")
```

An icon array displays the entire population of inmates classified by condition (whether they will reoffend or not) and decisions (our test's predictions). We can plot this display for our scenario by using the `plot` function and specifying the `plot.type = "icons"`:

```{r icons, fig.width = 7.2, fig.height = 4.8}
plot(my.scenario, plot.type = "icons")
```

From the icon array, We can easily see that roughly half of the inmates reoffend (see the icons in dark green and dark red). The majority of the reoffenders are classified correctly (shown in dark green rather than dark red). 

But where is John D.? His test result predicted that he would reoffend. Depending on his actual behavior, this means that he will _either_ be classified as a "reoffender found" (if he actually reoffends: dark green icons) _or_ as a "false accusation" (if he does not reoffend: light red icons). As there are a similar number of both types of icons (with some skew towards "reoffenders found"), it appears that his chances of actually reoffending are only slighly higher than chance.

To dig into the dirty details of `my.scenario`, let's look at its `summary`:

```{r full_summary}
summary(my.scenario)
```


+++ here now +++

From there we can read off some specifics of our scenario like the name, the condition of interest, what our decision is based on (the test), and how many individuals are there.  Moreover, we can read out probabilities, frequencies, and overall accuracy.  This contains much information we actually don't need to answer our question.   So we might want to limit this to the probabilities, as we are interested in the probability of reoffending, given a positive test result, the _positive predictive value_ or `PPV`. 

```{r summary_prob}
summary(my.scenario, summarize = "prob")
```

Reading off `PPV` from the table we can see that the rough intuition was almost correct with about 60% with a positive test result actually reoffending. 

We may even visualize this using a frequency tree: 

```{r tree, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(my.scenario, plot.type = "tree", by = "dc")
```

We find again the PPV here.  From its complement (.403) we can infer that it is around 60%.  

We can also infer additional information.  For instance, those that get a negative test result (i.e., the test suggests that they will not reoffend) will likely actually not reoffend.  The NPV (infered from the complement; see also the summary above) suggests that this holds in around 97% of all cases. 

A final way of visualizing this are curves which are dependent on prevalence. 

```{r plotting_curve, fig.width=7, fig.height=5.5}
plot(my.scenario, plot.type = "curve")
```

Here we see again our PPV of around 60% and the NPV of around 97%.  We can see that if prevalence dropped or was actually lower than 45%, the informativeness of a positve test result about reoffending would drop considerably.  

This illustrated, how you can create a scenario from risk information and visualize it with `riskyr`. 

For further information on underlying principles and additional functionalities see [User guide](A_user_guide.html). 


### Using existing scenarios

As defining your own scenarios can be cumbersome and the literature is full of similar problems (of so-called Bayesian reasoning), `riskyr` provides a set of (currently 25) pre-defined scenarios (stored in a list `scenarios`). 

Here is a table of all scenarios avaliable, including some information on the relevant condition and decision, as well as the probabilities (for additional information see `scen.txt`):  

```{r scenario_table, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
scen.table <- df.scenarios[-1,
                           c("scen.lbl", "cond.lbl", "N", "prev",
                             "sens", "spec", "fart")]
scen.table[, -c(1:2)] <- round(scen.table[, -c(1:2)], 3)
names(scen.table) <- c("Scenario", "Condition", "N", "prev", "sens", "spec", "fart")
kable(scen.table)
```


Show (some columns of) `scenarios` as table?

Here is how you can explore them: 

Let's consider Scenarios 21 and 22, starting with Scenario 21:  

    `r scenarios$n21$scen.txt`

```{r example_use_a, fig.width=7, fig.height=5.5}
## (a) PSA screening with high prevalence: ----------
s21 <- scenarios$n21  # assign pre-defined Scenario_21 to s
```

First, we summarize all of the information: 

```{r summary_s21}
summary(s21) # shows all scenario information.
```

If we are only interested in frequencies, we can look at these: 

```{r summary_s21_freq}
summary(s21, summarize = "freq") # shows frequencies. 
```

Now we can consider a few graphics: 

```{r s21_net, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(s21) # plots a network diagram (by default)
```


```{r s21_icons, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
plot(s21, plot.type = "icons", cex.lbl = 0.75)
```


```{r s21_curve, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
plot(s21, plot.type = "curve", what = "all")
```


Now we contrast this with Scenario 22: 

    `r scenarios$n22$scen.txt` 

```{r s22_summary}
s22 <- scenarios$n22  # assign pre-defined Scenario_22 to s22. 

summary(s22)
```


We see that the prevalence in scenario 22 is way lower than in scenario 21.  Besides this, they are equivalent, i.e., they use the same test. 

But how does this affect the value of the test?  

```{r example_use_b, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=5.5}
op <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))  # set plotting space for direct comparison. 

## Contrast two versions: 
plot(s21, plot.type = "plane", what = "PPV", cex.lbl = 0.75)
plot(s22, plot.type = "plane", what = "PPV", cex.lbl = 0.75)
```

Firstly, these planes clearly illustrate that with a high prevalence the positive predictive value is considerably higher than with a low prevalence.  Additionally, it can be seen that decreasing specificity and sensitivity in a scenario with high prevalence has a stronger impact.  In a scenario with low prevalence an increase in specificity , in turn, has a very strong impact, while there is not so much room for improvement with high prevalence. 

```{r examples_NPV, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=5.5}
op <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))  # set plotting space for direct comparison. 

## Contrast two versions: 
plot(s21, plot.type = "plane", what = "NPV", cex.lbl = 0.75)
plot(s22, plot.type = "plane", what = "NPV", cex.lbl = 0.75)
```

Apparently, for low prevalence things are vice versa. 

For further information see [User guide](A_user_guide.html). 

```{r reset_par, echo = FALSE}
par(op)
```


Now have fun exploring the provided examples, as well as creating and exploring your own examples.
