Description: Provides a set of basic risk literacy tools in R.
    We begin with a condition (e.g., a disease) and a corresponding decision (e.g., a clinical judgment or the result of a diagnostic test). 
    Based on 3 basic probabilities (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity) the package provides a range of metrics and alternative representations of propabilities and frequencies (for a population of N individuals). 
    By offering a variety of perspectives on the interplay between these parameters, the package renders teaching and training of risk literacy more transparent.
