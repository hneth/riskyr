## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

 * omitted the redundant part "A Toolbox for" in the title. 

 * written the package name in single quotes ('riskyr') in the description. 

 * simplified the Description in DESCRIPTION to make it more appropriate and general (by no longer referring to particular methods). 

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.4.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

  * checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

Maintainer: 'Hansjoerg Neth <h.neth@uni.kn>'

New submission

This is a first submission.

## Downstream dependencies

* None (as this is a first release).
